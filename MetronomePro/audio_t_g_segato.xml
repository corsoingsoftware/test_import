      <desc>Maybe if you want, you can remove the three import statement that you don&apos;t use in the class,</desc>

      <desc>Checklist for code review:
Structure
- Is the code well-structured, consistent in style, and consistently formatted?
- Are there any uncalled or unneeded procedures or any unreachable code?
- Can any code be replaced by calls to external reusable components or library functions?
- Are there any blocks of repeated code that could be condensed into a single procedure?
- Are symbolics used rather than “magic number” constants or string constants (hardcoding)?
- Are any modules excessively complex and should be restructured or split into multiple routines?
Documentation
- Is the code clearly and adequately documented with an easy-to-maintain commenting style?
- Are all comments consistent with the code?
Variables
- Are all variables properly defined with meaningful, consistent, and clear names?
- Do all assigned variables have proper type consistency or casting?
- Are there any redundant or unused variables?
Loops and branches
- Are all loops, branches, and logic constructs complete, correct, and properly nested?
- Are the most common cases tested first in IF ELSEIF chains?
- Are all cases covered in an IF ELSEIF or CASE block, including ELSE or DEFAULT clauses?
- Does every case statement have a default?
- Are loop termination conditions obvious and invariably achievable?
- Can any statements that are enclosed within loops be placed outside the loops?
Defensive programming
- Are imported data and input arguments tested for validity and completeness?
- Are all output variables assigned?
- Is every memory allocation deallocated?
- Are all files and devices are left in the correct state upon program termination?</desc>

      <desc>Excellent description of the use of the class, and good documentations of methods with explanatory comments.
I didn&apos;t find great problems in the code, it seems without error.
Excellent development.</desc>

      <desc>The number 60 (repeated in the lines 134, 215, 217) would be better to put it as a constant?</desc>
